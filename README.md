Start-up’s Headache:

Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? 

The Objective is to try to predict which valuable employees will leave next so that it can be prevented.

Fields in the dataset include:

Last evaluation
Number of projects
Average monthly hours
Time spent at the company
Whether they have had a work accident
Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
Department
Salary
Whether the employee has left
(Each row corresponds to an employee)

1. Who is leaving?

Create a data frame with only the people that have left the company, and can visualise what is the distribution of each features in a bar chart.

You can see some people don’t work well as we can see from their evaluation, but clearly there are also many good workers that leave.

2. Find out why good people leave.

3. Now use different Predictive modelling to find out which valuable employee will leave next and its probability score.
